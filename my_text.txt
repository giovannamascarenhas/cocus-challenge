Develop a Webservice in Python that reads a local textfile and on call of a GET function
returns a random line of that file. The random line shall be returned encapsulated in
JSON or XML depending on the request that is made. The file will have less than 10000
Lines.
Write a script that consumes the web-service from #1, takes the resulting line and
inserts it into a database including the character that occurs most often in that line.
Write a script that renders a Jinja2 Template (or other compatible template languages)
with 5 example lines from the database including the character that occurs most often
on each line. Additionally, fetch the character that occurs most often on the whole
database. Add a button to that page that - via JavaScript - fetches another line from
the webservice and merges that into the output.
